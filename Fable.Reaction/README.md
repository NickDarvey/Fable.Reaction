# Fable.Reaction

Fable.Reaciton combines the power of reactive programming with [Fable](http://fable.io/) and [Elmish](https://elmish.github.io/) applications.

Use reative programming for easier handling of events such as keyboard, mouse, network and websockets. Fable.Reaction gives you the power to:

- Transform - change messages
- Filter - reducing the message stream
- Time-shift - delay messages
- Partition - split a stream into multiple streams
- Combine - merge multiple streams into one

Fable.Reaction is is built on the Async Reactive ([Rx](http://reactivex.io/)) library
