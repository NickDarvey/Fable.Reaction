Fable.Reaction is a library combining reactive programming with the
model view update (MVU) style architecture. Fable.Reaction builds on
React Hooks and can perform any task. Think of them as live components
that you can include anywhere in your view or be mounted anywhere on the
page.

Fable.Reaction can easily be used together with Fable.Elmish, but have
no dependency on Elmish itself. Views and components built using
Fable.Reaction can be included in Elmish views or mounted by themselves
anywhere on the page.
