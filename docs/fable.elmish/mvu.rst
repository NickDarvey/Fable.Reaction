Reactive MVU Architecture
=========================

Elmish.Streams is very similar to `Elm <http://elm-lang.org/>`_ and
`Elmish <https://elmish.github.io/>`_ in regards to the `MVU
architecture <https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/>`_. But when using
Elmish.Streams, we do not need any commands (``Cmd``) or subscriptions
with Elmish. Instead we use a `ReactiveX <http://reactivex.io/>`_
(AsyncRx) style query that transforms the stream of messages (``Msg``).

* **Model**, application state as immutable data

* **View**, a pure function that takes the model to produce the output
  view (HTML elements)

* **Message**, a data event that represents a change. Messages are
  generated by the view, or they may be generated by a stream,
  e.g. timer or initial message events.

* **Update**, a pure function that produces a new model based on a
  received message and the previous model

In addition, Elmish Streams may also have a stream that
transforms the "stream" of messages.

* **Stream**, a function that takes the message stream and produces a
  new (transformed) message stream. Note that this also replaces the
  need for Elm(ish) commands (Cmd) since the stream is free to
  produce any messages (out of thin air), transform, filter, time-shift
  messages or combine side-effects such as web requests (fetch) etc.
