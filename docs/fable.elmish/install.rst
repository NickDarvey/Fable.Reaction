Elmish.Streams is available as a `NuGet
<https://www.nuget.org/packages/Fable.Elmish.Streams/>`_ package for ``NETStandard
2.0``.

Elmish.Streams is the new release for Fable ~> 3 and follows the Fable
versioning scheme, i.e if you use `Fable.Core ~> 3`, you should use
`Fable.Elmish.Streams ~> 3`. For `Fable.Core ~> 2`, you need to use
`Fable.Elmish.Reaction ~> 2`, but note that Fable/Reaction is now
legacy, has a slightly different API and will not be supported anymore.
